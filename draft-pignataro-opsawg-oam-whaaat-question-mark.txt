                   Guidelines for Charactering "OAM"
           draft-pignataro-opsawg-oam-whaaat-question-mark-00

Abstract

   As the IETF continues to produce and standardize different
   Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) protocols and
   technologies, various qualifiers and modifiers are prepended to the
   OAM acronym.  While, at first glance, the most used appear to be well
   understood, the same qualifier may be interpreted differently in
   different contexts.  A case in point is the qualifiers "in-band" and
   "out-of-band" which have their origins in the radio lexicon and which
   have been extrapolated into other communication networks.

   This document considers some common qualifiers and modifiers that are
   prepended to the OAM acronym, and lays out guidelines for their use
   in future IETF work.

   This document updates RFC 6291 by adding to the guidelines for the
   use of the term "OAM".

1.  Introduction

   It is not uncommon for historical and popular terms to have
   fundamental nuances in how they are interpreted or understood.  This
   was, for example, the case with the acronym "OAM", and [RFC6291]
   provided guidelines for its use as well as definitions of its
   constituent parts.

   Characterizations or qualifiers for "OAM" often encounter similar
   problems, such as with the adjective phrases "in-band" and "out-of-
   band".  This document considers some common qualifiers and modifiers
   that are prepended to the OAM acronym, and lays out guidelines for
   their use in future IETF work to achieve unambiguous
   characterization.

   Additionally, this document recommends avoiding the creation and use
   of extended acronyms for the qualifiers of "OAM".  For example, the
   first "O" in "OOAM" could mean out-of-band, overlay, or something
   else.

   This document updates [RFC6291] by adding to the guidelines for the
   use of the term "OAM".

2.  In-Band and Out-of-Band OAM

   Historically, the terms "in-band" and "out-of-band" appear in radio
   communications, where there actually was a "Band" (i.e., a "Channel"
   or "Frequency".)  It was also used extensively in telephony signaling
   [RFC4733].

   While those terms, useful in their simplicity, continued to be
   broadly used to mean "within something" and "outside said something",
   a challenge is presented for IP communications which does not have a
   "band" per se, and, in fact, has multiple "somethings" that OAM can
   go within or outside.  A frequently encountered case is the use of
   in-band to mean either in-packet or in-path.

   The guidance in this document is to avoid the terms "*-band" and
   instead find finer-granularity descriptive terms.  The definitions
   presented in this document are for use in all future IETF documents
   that refer to OAM, and the terms "in-band OAM" and "out-of-band OAM"
   are not to be used in future documents.

   Path:  OAM in relation to a path.

      Path-Congruent OAM:
         The OAM messages follow the exact same path as the observed
         data traffic.  This was sometimes referred to as "in-band".

      Non-Path-Congruent OAM:
         The OAM messages do not follow the same path as the observed
         data traffic.  This was sometimes referred to as "out-of-band".

      [RFC6669] gives an example of "Path-Congruent OAM", and further
      describes that the OAM Packets "share their fate with data
      packets."

   Packet:  OAM in relation to a user data packet.

      In-Packet OAM:
         The OAM messages are carried as part of data traffic.  This was
         sometimes referred to as "in-band".

      Dedicated-Packet OAM:
         The OAM messages have their own OAM packets, separate from data
         traffic.  This was sometimes referred to as "out-of-band".

      The MPLS echo request/reply messages [RFC8029] are an example of

Internet-Draft             Characterizing OAM              December 2023


      "Dedicated-Packet OAM", since they are described as "An MPLS echo
      request/reply is a (possibly labeled) IPv4 or IPv6 UDP packet".

      In Situ OAM [RFC9197] is an example of "In-Packet OAM", given that
      it 'records OAM information within the packet while the packet
      traverses a particular network domain.  The term "in situ" refers
      to the fact that the OAM data is added to the data packets rather
      than being sent within packets specifically dedicated to OAM.'

      Initially "In Situ OAM" [IETF96-In-Band-OAM] was also referred to
      as "In-band OAM", but was renamed due to the overloaded meaning of
      "in-band OAM".  Further, [RFC9232] also intertwines the terms "in-
      band" with "in situ", though [I-D.song-opsawg-ifit-framework]
      settled on using "In Situ".  Other similar uses, including
      [P4-INT-2.1] and [I-D.kumar-ippm-ifa], still use variations of
      "in-band", "in band", or "inband".

   Packet Treatment:  OAM in relation to the treatment of user data
      packets, as for example QoS treatment.

      Equal-QoS-Treatment OAM:
         The OAM packets receive the same QoS treatment as user data
         packets.  This was sometimes referred to as "in-band".

      Different-QoS-Treatment OAM:
         The OAM packets receive different QoS treatment as user data
         packets.  This was sometimes referred to as "out-of-band".

      For a case of either "Non-Path-Congruent OAM" or "Different-QoS-
      Treatment OAM", [I-D.ietf-detnet-oam-framework] says "Out-of-band
      OAM is an active OAM whose path through the DetNet domain is not
      topologically identical to the path of the monitored DetNet flow,
      or its test packets receive different QoS and/or PREOF treatment,
      or both."  [I-D.ietf-raw-architecture] uses similar text.

   Combined:  OAM in relation to multiple criteria.  For example, in
      relation to both topological congruence and packet treatment.
      Examples include [I-D.ietf-detnet-oam-framework] and
      [I-D.ietf-raw-architecture].

      [I-D.ietf-detnet-oam-framework] uses Combined OAM when it says
      "In-band OAM is an active OAM that is in-band within the monitored
      DetNet OAM domain when it traverses the same set of links and
      interfaces receiving the same QoS and Packet Replication,
      Elimination, and Ordering Functions (PREOF) treatment as the
      monitored DetNet flow".  [I-D.ietf-raw-architecture] uses similar
      text.

2.1.  Historical Uses

   There are many examples of "in-band OAM" and "out-of-band OAM" in
   published RFCs.  While interpreting those, it is important to
   understand the semantics of what "band" is a proxy for, and to be
   more explicit if those documents are updated.  This document does not
   change the meaning of any terms in any prior RFCs.

   For example, [RFC5085] says "as in-band traffic with the PW's data,
   or out-of-band", and "in-band (i.e., following the same data-plane
   faith as PW data)".  Hence, the term "band" refers to the "Pseudowire
   data".

3.  Active, Passive, Hybrid, and Compound OAM

   [RFC7799] provides clear definitions for active and passive
   performance assessment such that the construction of metrics and
   methods can be described as either "Active" or "Passive".  Even
   though [RFC7799] does not include the specific terms "Active",
   "Passive", or "Hybrid" as modifiers of "OAM", the following terms are
   used in many RFCs and are provided here for use in all future IETF
   documents that refer to OAM.

   Active OAM:
      Depends on dedicated instrumentation OAM packets.

   Passive OAM:
      Depends solely on the observation of one or more existing data
      packet streams, and does not use dedicated OAM packets.

   Hybrid OAM:
      Uses instrumentation or modification of data packets themselves.
      [RFC9341] and [RFC9197] are examples labeled "Hybrid OAM" under
      this definition.

   Compound OAM:
      Uses a combination of at least two of Active OAM, Passive OAM, and
      Hybrid OAM (i.e., a combination of atomic OAM packets, data packet
      modification for OAM, and no OAM packet).  Note that [RFC7799]
      also uses the term "Hybrid" to refer to metric types in-between
      active and passive, for OAM there are no in-betweens per se, only
      active, passive, hybrid, or a combination.

      Compound OAM can further be characterized in a more explicit way,
      for nuanced use-cases.

      *  Active-Passive OAM.

Internet-Draft             Characterizing OAM              December 2023


      *  Active-Hybrid OAM.

      *  Hybrid-Passive OAM.

      *  Active-Hybrid-Passive OAM.

   [RFC7799] adds to the confusion by describing "passive methods" as
   "out of band".  Following the guidelines of this document, OAM may be
   qualified according to the terms described in Sections 2 and 3 of
   this document, and the term "out of band OAM" is not to be used in
   future documents.

4.  Security Considerations

   Security is improved when the terms used and their definitions are
   unambiguous.
