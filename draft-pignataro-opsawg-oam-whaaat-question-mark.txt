                   Guidelines for Charactering "OAM"
           draft-pignataro-opsawg-oam-whaaat-question-mark-00

Abstract

   As the IETF continues to produce and standardize different
   Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) protocols and
   technologies, various qualifiers and modifiers are prepended to the
   OAM acronym.  While, at first glance, the most used appear to be well
   understood, experience has shown repeatedly that there is aliasing of
   terms (i.e., the same qualifier is interpreted to have different
   specific meaning.)  This is notorious with the qualifiers "in-band"
   and "out-of-band", given that those are extrapolations from radio
   lexicon into communication networks.

   This document explains the frequently-encountered problem, and lays
   out guideliens for use of qualifying terms when characteriging OAM.

   This document maybe updates RFC 6291.

1.  Introduction

   It is not uncoming for historical and popular terms to have
   fundamental nuances in how they are interpreted or understood.  This
   was for example the case with the acronym "OAM", and [RFC6291]
   provided guidelines for its use as well as definitions of its
   consitutive parts.

   Experience shows that trying to characterize or qualify "OAM" often
   encounters similar problems.  Specifically, with the adjective
   phrases "in-band" and "out-of-band".  This document explains the root
   of the problem and proposes an unambiguous characterization.

2.  Aliasing of In-Band and Out-of-Band

   Historically, the terms "in-band" and "out-of-band" appear (likely,
   citation?) in radio communications, where there actually was a "Band"
   (i.e., a "Channel" of "Frequency".)

   While those terms, useful in their simplicity, continued to be
   broadly used to mean "within something" and "outside said
   soomething", a challenge is presented when IP communications does not
   have a "band" per se, and in fact has multiple "somethings" that an
   OAM can go within or outside.  A frequently encountered case is in-
   band to mean either in-packet or in-path.

   The guideline on this document is to, first, attempt to avoid the
   terms "*-band" and instead find finer-granulary descriptive terms, as
   for example.

   Path:  OAM in relationship to a path.

      Path-Congruent OAM:
         The OAM protocol follow the exact same path as the observed
         data traffic.  This was sometimes refered to as "in-band".

      Non-Path-Congruent OAM:
         The OAM protocol does not follow the same path as the observed
         data traffic.  This was sometimes refered to as "out-of-band".

      [RFC6669] gives an example of "Path-Congruent OAM", and further
      describes the OAM Packets "share their fate with data packets."

   Node:  OAM in relationship to a node.

      Node-Traversing OAM:
         The OAM protocol traverses through a node.  This was sometimes
         refered to as "in-band".

      Node-Skipping OAM:
         The OAM protocol does not traverse through a node.  This was
         sometimes refered to as "out-of-band".

   Packet:  OAM in relationship to a user data packet.

      In-Packet OAM:
         The OAM protocol is carried as part of data traffic.  This was
         sometimes refered to as "in-band".

      Packet-Dedicated OAM:
         The OAM protocol has its own OAM packets, separated from data
         traffic.  This was sometimes refered to as "out-of-band".

      In Situ OAM [RFC9197] is an example of "In-Packet OAM", given that
      it 'records OAM information within the packet while the packet
      traverses a particular network domain.  The term "in situ" refers
      to the fact that the OAM data is added to the data packets rather
      than being sent within packets specifically dedicated to OAM.'

   Packet Treatment:  OAM in relationship to the treatment of user data
      packets, as for example QoS treatment.

      Equal-QoS-Treatment OAM:

         The OAM packets receive the same QoS treatment as user data
         packets.  This was sometimes refered to as "in-band".

      Different-QoS-Treatment OAM:
         The OAM packets receive different QoS treatment as user data
         packets.  This was sometimes refered to as "out-of-band".

   Combined:  OAM in relationship to multiple criteria.  For example, in
      relationship to both topological congruence and packet treatment.
      One such examples is [I-D.ietf-raw-architecture].

2.1.  Historical Uses

   There are many examples of "in-band OAM" and "out-of-band OAM" in
   published documents.  While interpreting those, it is important to
   understand the semantics of what is "band" a proxy for, and to be
   more explicit when those documents are updated.

   For example, [RFC5085] uses *-band to refer to the packets "as in-
   band traffic with the PW's data, or out-of-band", and "in-band (i.e.,
   following the same data-plane faith as PW data)".  Hence, the
   inexisting "band" would refer to the "Pseudowire data".

3.  Active, Passive, and Hybrid OAM

   Even though [RFC7799] does not include the specific terms Active,
   Passive, and Hybrid as modifiers of OAM, the following terms are
   generally used and well understood:

   Active OAM:
      Depends on dedicated instrumentation OAM packet.

   Passive OAM:
      Depends *solely* on the observation of one or more existing data
      packet streams, and does not use dedicated OAM packets.

   Hybrid OAM:
      Has two definitions:

      *  Uses either a combination of Active OAM and Passive OAM.

      *  Uses instrumentation or modification of data packets
         themselves.

   Unfortunately, [RFC7799] also describes "passive methods" as "out of
   band", adding to the confusion.  This document recommends removing
   that additional qualification.

4.  Use of OAM-Modifying Acronyms

   It is not surprising to see how also several proposed and used
   acronyms alias.  For example, is does the "I" in "IOAM" stand for in-
   band, in situ, or something else?  Is the "O" in "OOAM" for overlay,
   for out-of-band, or something else?  In light of the potential and
   experienced confusion caused by OAM extended characterization and
   acronyms this document's position is to simply avoid using them.

5.  Security Considerations

   Security is improved when the terms used and their definitions are
   unambiguous.

6.  Acknowledgements

   The creation of this document was triggered when observing one of
   many on-mailing-list discussions of what these terms mean, and how to
   abbreviate them.  Participants on that mailing thread include,
