    <abstract>
      <t>
   As the IETF continues to produce and standardize different
   Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) protocols and
   technologies, various qualifiers and modifiers are prepended to the
   OAM abbreviation.  While, at first glance, the most used appear to be well
   understood, the same qualifier may be interpreted differently in
   different contexts.  A case in point is the qualifiers "in-band" and
   "out-of-band" which have their origins in the radio lexicon, and which
   have been extrapolated into other communication networks.
      </t>
      <t>
   This document considers some common qualifiers and modifiers that are
   prepended, within the context of packet networks, to the OAM abbreviation and lays out guidelines for their use
   in future IETF work.
      </t>
      <t>This document updates RFC 6291 by adding to the guidelines for the
   use of the term "OAM". It does not modify any other part of RFC 6291.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
      It is not uncommon for historical and popular terms to have nuances in how they are interpreted or understood. This was, for example, the case with the abbreviation for Operations, Administration, and Maintenance, "OAM", and <xref target="RFC6291" /> provided guidelines for its use as well as definitions of its constituent parts.
      </t>
      <t>
   Characterizations or qualifiers for "OAM" within packet networks often encounter similar
   problems of interpretation, such as with the adjective phrases "in-band" and "out-of-band".  This document considers some common qualifiers and modifiers
   that are prepended to the OAM abbreviation, and lays out guidelines for
   their use in future IETF work to achieve consistent and unambiguous
   characterization.
      </t>
      <t>
   This document updates <xref target="RFC6291" /> by adding to the guidelines for the
   use of the term "OAM". It does not modify any other part of <xref target="RFC6291" />.
      </t>

    </section>

      <section anchor="band" title="In-Band and Out-of-Band OAM">


        <t>
          Historically, the terms "in-band" and "out-of-band" were used extensively in radio communications as well as in telephony signaling <xref target="RFC4733" />. In both these cases, there is an actual "Band" (i.e., a "Channel" or "Frequency") to be within or outside.
        </t>
        <t>
          While those terms, useful in their simplicity, continued to be broadly used to mean "within something" and "outside something", a challenge is presented for IP communications and packet-switched networks (PSNs) which do not have a "band" per se, and, in fact, have multiple "somethings" that OAM can be carried within or outside. A frequently encountered case is the use of "in-band" to mean either in-packet or on-path.
        </t>
        <t>
          Within the IETF, the terms "in-band" and "out-of-band" cannot be reliably understood consistently and unambiguously. Context-specific definitions of these terms are inconsistent and therefore cannot be generalized. More importantly, the terms are not self-defining to any further extent and cannot be understood by someone exposed to them for the first time, since there is no "band" in IP.
        </t>

      <section anchor="terms" title="Terminology and Guidance">


        <t>
          This document recommends avoiding the terms "in-band" and "out-of-band" when referring to OAM. Instead, it encourages the use of more fine-grained and descriptive terminology. The document also presents alternative terms and definitions for use in future IETF documents referencing OAM, without precluding the use of other precise, descriptive terms that do not rely on the "-band" convention.
        </t>
        <t>
          In this document, the term “path-congruent” describes packets that follow the exact same path (i.e., traverse the same nodes and links) within a network. Note that this definition does not describe how the packets are treated in queues within the nodes on the path. A further concept, “equal-forwarding-treatment” describes how path-congruent packets receive the same forwarding (e.g., Quality of Service) treatment.
        </t>
        <t>


          <list style="hanging">


<t hangText="Path OAM:"> OAM in relation to a path</t>
<t>
          <list style="hanging">
<t hangText="Path-Congruent OAM:"><br />The OAM information follows the exact same path as the observed data traffic. This was sometimes referred to as "in-band".</t>
<t hangText="Non-Path-Congruent OAM:"><br />The OAM information does not follow the exact same path as the observed data traffic. This can also be called Path-Incongruent OAM, and was sometimes referred to as "out-of-band".</t>
          </list>
</t>
        <t>An example of "Path-Congruent OAM" is the Virtual 
		Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV), described
		is Section 6 of <xref target="RFC5085" /> as "The VCCV
        message travels in-band with the Session and follows the exact same
        path as the user data for the session". Thus,
		the term "in-band" in <xref target="RFC5085" /> refers to using the same path as the user data.
		This term is also used in Section 2 of <xref target="RFC6669" /> with the same meaning,
        and the word "congruent" is mentioned as synonymous.		
		</t>


<t hangText="Active, Passive, Hybrid, and In-Packet OAM"></t>

          <t>
               <xref target="RFC7799" /> provides clear definitions for active and passive
               performance assessment such that the construction of metrics and
               methods can be described as either "Active" or "Passive".  Even
               though <xref target="RFC7799" /> does not include the specific terms "Active",
               "Passive", or "Hybrid" as modifiers of "OAM", the following terms
               are used in many RFCs and are provided here for clarity.
          
            <list style="hanging">
              <t hangText="Active OAM:"><br /> Depends on dedicated OAM packets.</t>
              <t hangText="Passive OAM:"><br /> Depends solely on the observation of one
      or more existing data packet streams and does not use dedicated OAM packets.</t>
               <t hangText="Hybrid OAM:"><br /> Uses instrumentation or modification of the data 
                 stream. Examples of protocols classified as "Hybrid OAM" 
                 include <xref target="RFC9341" />, <xref target="RFC9197" />, and <xref target="RFC6374" />. Hybrid 
                 OAM can be implemented by piggybacking OAM-related information onto data 
                 packets, as described in <xref target="RFC9197" />, or by utilizing reserved 
                 fields in the packet header or specific values of existing header fields, 
                 as proposed in <xref target="RFC9341" />. Direct loss measurment <xref target="RFC6374" />
				         is an example of "Hybrid OAM" in which user packets are not modified by the protocol. Instead,
				         OAM packets are used to exchange information about user packet counters, allowing for
				         packet loss computation.
               </t>
            </list>
          </t>

            <t>This document defines the term In-Packet OAM, which is a special case of Hybrid OAM:</t>
<t>
          <list style="hanging">
<t hangText="In-Packet OAM:"><br />The OAM information is carried in the packets that also carry the data traffic. This was sometimes referred to as "in-band".</t>
          </list>
</t>

<t>
  The MPLS echo request/reply messages <xref target="RFC8029" /> are an example of "Active OAM", since they are described as "An MPLS echo request/reply is a (possibly MPLS-labeled) IPv4 or IPv6 UDP packet".
</t>


<t>In situ OAM <xref target="RFC9197" /> is an example of "In-Packet OAM", given that it: '...records OAM information
  within the packet while the packet traverses a particular network
  domain.  The term "in situ" refers to the fact that the OAM data is
  added to the data packets rather than being sent within packets
  specifically dedicated to OAM.' On the other hand, direct loss measurement <xref target="RFC6374" />
  is an example of "Hybrid OAM" which is not classified as "In-Packet OAM".
</t>
<t>
  Initially, "In situ OAM" <xref target="RFC9197" /> was also referred to as "In-band OAM" <xref target="I-D.brockners-inband-oam-data" />, but was renamed due to the overloaded meaning of "In-band OAM". Further, <xref target="RFC9232" /> also intertwines the terms "in-band" with "in situ", though <xref target="I-D.song-opsawg-ifit-framework" /> settled on using "in Situ". Other similar uses, including <xref target="P4-INT-2.1" /> and <xref target="I-D.kumar-ippm-ifa" />, still use variations of "in-band", "in band", or "inband".
</t>

<!--
<t>
  It is noteworthy that In-Packet OAM cannot be Non-Path-Congruent OAM.
</t>
-->



<t hangText="Packet Forwarding Treatment OAM:"> OAM in relation to the forwarding treatment of user data packets, as for example QoS treatment.</t>
<t>
          <list style="hanging">
<t hangText="Equal-Forwarding-Treatment OAM:"><br />The OAM packets receive the same forwarding (e.g., QoS) treatment as user data packets. This was sometimes referred to as "in-band".</t>
<t hangText="Different-Forwarding-Treatment OAM:"><br />The OAM packets receive different forwarding (e.g., QoS) treatment as user data packets. This was sometimes referred to as "out-of-band".</t>
          </list>
</t>
<t>
As an example, the behavior of "Equal-Forwarding-Treatment OAM" is described in <xref target="RFC9551" /> as "it traverses the same set of links and interfaces receiving the same QoS and Packet Replication, Elimination, and Ordering Functions (PREOF) treatment as the monitored DetNet flow". This is classified in <xref target="RFC9551" /> as "In-band OAM".
Similarly, the property of "Different-Forwarding-Treatment OAM" can be found in the following definition in <xref target="RFC9551" />: 

"Out-of-band OAM:
an active OAM method whose path through the DetNet domain may not be topologically identical to the path of the monitored DetNet flow, its test packets may receive different QoS and/or PREOF treatment, or both."
<xref target="I-D.ietf-raw-architecture" /> uses similar text.

</t>


<t>Note that OAM can be classified in relation to multiple criteria, e.g., relating to both topological congruence and packet treatment, as well as other criteria, such as active, passive or hybrid <xref target="RFC7799" />. 
For example, <xref target="RFC9551" /> classifies OAM both in terms of whether it is active or passive as well as in terms of whether it receives the same treatment as the user traffic. 
</t>


          </list>

    </section>

    <section anchor="Historical" title="Historical Uses">
            <t>
              There are many examples of "in-band OAM" and "out-of-band OAM" in published RFCs. For instance, the term "in-band" appears in both <xref target="RFC5085" /> and <xref target="RFC9551" />. While the context in each of these documents is clear, the term carries different meanings in each case.
            </t>
            <t>
			  While interpreting existing documents, it is important to understand the semantics of what "band" is a proxy for, and to be more explicit if those documents are updated. This document does not change the meaning of any terms in any prior RFCs.

<t> In-band operation, administration and maintenance (OAM) records operational and telemetry information in the packet while the packet traverses a path between two points in the network. This document discusses the data types and data formats for in-band OAM data records. In-band OAM data records can be embedded into a variety of transports such as NSH, Segment Routing, VXLAN-GPE, native IPv6 (via extension header), or IPv4. In-band OAM is to complement current out-of-band OAM mechanisms based on ICMP or other types of probe packets. </t>
