                  Guidelines for Characterizing "OAM"
               draft-ietf-opsawg-oam-characterization-07

Abstract

   As the IETF continues to produce and standardize different
   Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) protocols and
   technologies, various qualifiers and modifiers are prepended to the
   OAM abbreviation.  While, at first glance, the most used appear to be
   well understood, the same qualifier may be interpreted differently in
   different contexts.  A case in point is the qualifiers "in-band" and
   "out-of-band" which have their origins in the radio lexicon, and
   which have been extrapolated into other communication networks.

   This document considers some common qualifiers and modifiers that are
   prepended, within the context of packet networks, to the OAM
   abbreviation and lays out guidelines for their use in future IETF
   work.

   This document updates RFC 6291 by adding to the guidelines for the
   use of the term "OAM".  It does not modify any other part of RFC
   6291.

1.  Introduction

   It is not uncommon for historical and popular terms to have nuances
   in how they are interpreted or understood.  This was, for example,
   the case with the abbreviation for Operations, Administration, and
   Maintenance, "OAM", and [RFC6291] provided guidelines for its use as
   well as definitions of its constituent parts.

   Characterizations or qualifiers for "OAM" within packet networks
   often encounter similar problems of interpretation, such as with the
   adjective phrases "in-band" and "out-of-band".  This document
   considers some common qualifiers and modifiers that are prepended to
   the OAM abbreviation, and lays out guidelines for their use in future
   IETF work to achieve consistent and unambiguous characterization.

Internet-Draft             Characterizing OAM                  June 2025


   This document updates [RFC6291] by adding to the guidelines for the
   use of the term "OAM".  It does not modify any other part of
   [RFC6291].

2.  In-Band and Out-of-Band OAM

   Historically, the terms "in-band" and "out-of-band" were used
   extensively in radio communications as well as in telephony signaling
   [RFC4733].  In both these cases, there is an actual "Band" (i.e., a
   "Channel" or "Frequency") to be within or outside.

   While those terms, useful in their simplicity, continued to be
   broadly used to mean "within something" and "outside something", a
   challenge is presented for IP communications and packet-switched
   networks (PSNs) which do not have a "band" per se, and, in fact, have
   multiple "somethings" that OAM traffic can be carried within or
   outside.  A frequently encountered case is the use of "in-band" to
   mean either in-packet or on-path.

   Within the IETF, the terms "in-band" and "out-of-band" cannot be
   reliably understood consistently and unambiguously.  Context-specific
   definitions of these terms are inconsistent and therefore cannot be
   generalized.  More importantly, the terms are not self-defining to
   any further extent and cannot be understood by someone exposed to
   them for the first time, since there is no "band" in IP.

   There are many examples of "in-band OAM" and "out-of-band OAM" in
   published RFCs.  For instance, the term "in-band" appears in both
   [RFC5085] and [RFC9551].  While the context in each of these
   documents is clear, the term carries different meanings in each case.
   These two examples, as well as other examples of uses of the term
   "in-band" in previous documents are described throughout Section 3.

   While interpreting existing documents, it is important to understand
   the semantics of what "band" is a proxy for, and to be more explicit
   if those documents are updated.  This document does not change the
   meaning of any terms in any prior RFCs.

3.  Terminology and Guidance

   This document recommends avoiding the terms "in-band" and "out-of-
   band" when referring to OAM.  Instead, it encourages the use of more
   fine-grained and descriptive terminology.  The document also presents
   alternative terms and definitions for use in future IETF documents
   referencing OAM, without precluding the use of other precise,
   descriptive terms that do not rely on the "-band" convention.

Internet-Draft             Characterizing OAM                  June 2025


   The terminology presented in this section classifies OAM according to
   three criteria: whether it follows the same path as data traffic;
   whether it receives the same treatment as data traffic; and whether
   it operates in an active, passive, or hybrid mode.

3.1.  Path Followed OAM

   Path-Congruent OAM:
      The OAM information follows the exact same path as the observed
      data traffic.  This was sometimes referred to as "in-band".

   Non-Path-Congruent OAM:
      The OAM information does not follow the exact same path as the
      observed data traffic.  This can also be called Path-Incongruent
      OAM, and was sometimes referred to as "out-of-band".

   In this document, the term "path-congruent packets" describes packets
   that follow the exact same path (i.e., traverse the same nodes and
   links) within a network.  Note that this definition does not describe
   how the packets are treated in queues within the nodes on the path.
   A further concept, "equal-forwarding-treatment" describes how path-
   congruent packets receive the same forwarding treatment (e.g.,
   Quality of Service (QoS)).

   An example of "Path-Congruent OAM" is the Virtual Circuit
   Connectivity Verification (VCCV), described is [RFC5085] as "The VCCV
   message travels in-band with the Session and follows the exact same
   path as the user data for the session".  Thus, the term "in-band" in
   [RFC5085] refers to using the same path as the user data.  This term
   is also used in Section 2 of [RFC6669] with the same meaning, and the
   word "congruent" is mentioned as synonymous.

3.2.  Packet Forwarding Treatment OAM

   Equal-Forwarding-Treatment OAM:
      The OAM packets receive the same forwarding (e.g., QoS) treatment
      as user data packets.  This was sometimes referred to as "in-
      band".

   Different-Forwarding-Treatment OAM:
      The OAM packets receive different forwarding (e.g., QoS) treatment
      as user data packets.  This was sometimes referred to as "out-of-
      band".

   As an example, the behavior of "Equal-Forwarding-Treatment OAM" is
   described in [RFC9551] as "it traverses the same set of links and
   interfaces receiving the same QoS and Packet Replication,
   Elimination, and Ordering Functions (PREOF) treatment as the

   monitored DetNet flow".  This is classified in [RFC9551] as "In-band
   OAM".  Similarly, the property of "Different-Forwarding-Treatment
   OAM" can be found in the following definition in [RFC9551]: "Out-of-
   band OAM: an active OAM method whose path through the DetNet domain
   may not be topologically identical to the path of the monitored
   DetNet flow, its test packets may receive different QoS and/or PREOF
   treatment, or both."  [I-D.ietf-raw-architecture] uses similar text.

3.3.  Active, Passive, Hybrid, and In-Packet OAM

   [RFC7799] provides clear definitions for active and passive
   performance assessment such that the construction of metrics and
   methods can be described as either "Active" or "Passive".  Even
   though [RFC7799] does not include the specific terms "Active",
   "Passive", or "Hybrid" as modifiers of "OAM", the following terms are
   used in many RFCs and are provided here for clarity.

   Active OAM:
      Depends on dedicated OAM packets.

   Passive OAM:
      Depends solely on the observation of one or more existing data
      packet streams and does not use dedicated OAM packets.

   Hybrid OAM:
      Uses augmentation or modification of the packet stream.  Examples
      of protocols classified as "Hybrid OAM" include [RFC9341],
      [RFC9197], and [RFC6374].  Hybrid OAM can be implemented by
      piggybacking OAM-related information onto data packets, as
      described in [RFC9197], or by utilizing reserved fields in the
      packet header or specific values of existing header fields, as
      proposed in [RFC9341].  Direct loss measurment [RFC6374] is an
      example of "Hybrid OAM" in which user packets are not modified by
      the protocol.  Instead, OAM packets are used to exchange
      information about user packet counters, allowing for packet loss
      computation.

   This document defines the term In-Packet OAM as a more specific and
   narrowly scoped instance within the broader category of Hybrid OAM.

   In-Packet OAM:
      The OAM information is carried in the packets that also carry the
      data traffic.  This was sometimes referred to as "in-band".

   The MPLS echo request/reply messages [RFC8029] are an example of
   "Active OAM", since they are described as "An MPLS echo request/reply
   is a (possibly MPLS-labeled) IPv4 or IPv6 UDP packet".

Internet-Draft             Characterizing OAM                  June 2025


   In situ OAM [RFC9197] is an example of "Hybrid OAM" that is also "In-
   Packet OAM", given that it: '...records OAM information within the
   packet while the packet traverses a particular network domain.  The
   term "in situ" refers to the fact that the OAM data is added to the
   data packets rather than being sent within packets specifically
   dedicated to OAM.'

   An example of "Hybrid OAM" which is not classified as "In-Packet OAM"
   is Direct loss measurement [RFC6374].

   Initially, "In situ OAM" [RFC9197] was also referred to as "In-band
   OAM", but was renamed due to the overloaded meaning of "In-band OAM".
   Further, [RFC9232] also intertwines the terms "in-band" with "in
   situ", though [I-D.song-opsawg-ifit-framework] settled on using "in
   Situ".  Other similar uses, including [P4-INT-2.1] and
   [I-D.kumar-ippm-ifa], still use variations of "in-band", "in band",
   or "inband".

3.4.  Using Multiple Criteria

   Note that OAM can be classified in relation to multiple criteria,
   e.g., relating to both topological congruence and packet treatment,
   as well as other criteria, such as active, passive or hybrid
   [RFC7799].  For example, [RFC9551] classifies OAM both in terms of
   whether it is active or passive as well as in terms of whether it
   receives the same treatment as the user traffic.

4.  Security Considerations

   Security is improved when terms are used with precision, and their
   definitions are unambiguous.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
