                  Guidelines for Characterizing "OAM"
               draft-ietf-opsawg-oam-characterization-04

Abstract

   As the IETF continues to produce and standardize different
   Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) protocols and
   technologies, various qualifiers and modifiers are prepended to the
   OAM abbreviation.  While, at first glance, the most used appear to be
   well understood, the same qualifier may be interpreted differently in
   different contexts.  A case in point is the qualifiers "in-band" and
   "out-of-band" which have their origins in the radio lexicon, and
   which have been extrapolated into other communication networks.

   This document considers some common qualifiers and modifiers that are
   prepended, within the context of packet networks, to the OAM
   abbreviation and lays out guidelines for their use in future IETF
   work.

   This document updates RFC 6291 by adding to the guidelines for the
   use of the term "OAM".  It does not modify any other part of RFC
   6291.

1.  Introduction

   It is not uncommon for historical and popular terms to have nuances
   in how they are interpreted or understood.  This was, for example,
   the case with the abbreviation for Operations, Administration, and
   Maintenance, "OAM", and [RFC6291] provided guidelines for its use as
   well as definitions of its constituent parts.

   Characterizations or qualifiers for "OAM" within packet networks
   often encounter similar problems of interpretation, such as with the
   adjective phrases "in-band" and "out-of-band".  This document
   considers some common qualifiers and modifiers that are prepended to
   the OAM abbreviation, and lays out guidelines for their use in future
   IETF work to achieve consistent and unambiguous characterization.

Internet-Draft             Characterizing OAM              December 2024


   Additionally, this document recommends avoiding the creation and use
   of extended abbreviation for the qualifiers of "OAM".  For example,
   the first "O" in "OOAM" could mean out-of-band, overlay, or something
   else.

   This document updates [RFC6291] by adding to the guidelines for the
   use of the term "OAM".  It does not modify any other part of
   [RFC6291].

   Note that [RFC7799] defines terms for active and passive performance
   assessments through metrics and methods.  That RFC does not
   substantially discuss OAM, and although the concepts are similar,
   this document does not modify the definitions in [RFC7799].

2.  In-Band and Out-of-Band OAM

   Historically, the terms "in-band" and "out-of-band" were used
   extensively in radio communications as well as in telephony signaling
   [RFC4733].  In both these cases, there is an actual "Band" (i.e., a
   "Channel" or "Frequency") to be within or outside.

   While those terms, useful in their simplicity, continued to be
   broadly used to mean "within something" and "outside something", a
   challenge is presented for IP communications and packet switch
   networks (PSNs) which do not have a "band" per se, and, in fact, have
   multiple "somethings" that OAM can be carried within or outside.  A
   frequently encountered case is the use of "in-band" to mean either
   in-packet or on-path.

   Within the IETF, the terms "in-band" and "out-of-band" cannot be
   reliably understood consistently and unambiguously.  Context-specific
   redefinitions of these terms cannot be generalized and can be
   confused by participants from other contexts.  More importantly, the
   terms are not self-defining to any further extent and cannot be
   understood by someone exposed to them for the first time, since there
   is no "band" in IP.

2.1.  Terminology and Guidance

   The guidance in this document is to avoid the terms "in-band" and
   "out-of-band" when refering to OAM, and instead find finer-
   granularity descriptive terms.  The definitions presented in this
   document are for use in all future IETF documents that refer to OAM,
   and the terms "in-band OAM" and "out-of-band OAM" are not to be used
   in future documents.

   Path OAM:  OAM in relation to a path.

Internet-Draft             Characterizing OAM              December 2024


      Path-Congruent OAM:
         The OAM information follows the exact same path as the observed
         data traffic.  This was sometimes referred to as "in-band".

      Non-Path-Congruent OAM:
         The OAM information does not follow the exact same path as the
         observed data traffic.  This can also be called Path-
         Incongruent OAM, and was sometimes referred to as "out-of-
         band".

      [RFC6669], Section 2 fourth bullet, gives an example of "Path-
      Congruent OAM", and further describes that the OAM Packets "share
      their fate with data packets."

   Packet OAM:  OAM in relation to a user data packet.

      In-Packet OAM:
         The OAM information is carried in the packets that also carry
         the data traffic.  This was sometimes referred to as "in-band".

      Dedicated-Packet OAM:
         The OAM information is carried in its own OAM packets, separate
         from data traffic.  This was sometimes referred to as "out-of-
         band".

      The MPLS echo request/reply messages [RFC8029] are an example of
      "Dedicated-Packet OAM", since they are described as "An MPLS echo
      request/reply is a (possibly MPLS-labeled) IPv4 or IPv6 UDP
      packet".

      In situ OAM [RFC9197] is an example of "In-Packet OAM", given that
      it: '...records OAM information within the packet while the packet
      traverses a particular network domain.  The term "in situ" refers
      to the fact that the OAM data is added to the data packets rather
      than being sent within packets specifically dedicated to OAM.'

      Initially, "in situ OAM" [IETF96-In-Band-OAM] was also referred to
      as "In-band OAM", but was renamed due to the overloaded meaning of
      "in-band OAM".  Further, [RFC9232] also intertwines the terms "in-
      band" with "in situ", though [I-D.song-opsawg-ifit-framework]
      settled on using "in Situ".  Other similar uses, including
      [P4-INT-2.1] and [I-D.kumar-ippm-ifa], still use variations of
      "in-band", "in band", or "inband".

   Packet Forwarding Treatment OAM:  OAM in relation to the forwarding
      treatment of user data packets, as for example QoS treatment.

      Equal-Forwarding-Treatment OAM:



Pignataro & Farrel         Expires 1 July 2025                  [Page 4]

Internet-Draft             Characterizing OAM              December 2024


         The OAM packets receive the same forwarding (e.g., QoS)
         treatment as user data packets.  This was sometimes referred to
         as "in-band".

      Different-Forwarding-Treatment OAM:
         The OAM packets receive different forwarding (e.g., QoS)
         treatment as user data packets.  This was sometimes referred to
         as "out-of-band".

      For a case of either "Non-Path-Congruent OAM" or "Different-
      Forwarding-Treatment OAM", [RFC9551] says "Out-of-band OAM: an
      active OAM method whose path through the DetNet domain may not be
      topologically identical to the path of the monitored DetNet flow,
      its test packets may receive different QoS and/or PREOF treatment,
      or both."  [I-D.ietf-raw-architecture] uses similar text.

   Combined OAM:  OAM in relation to multiple criteria.  For example, in
      relation to both topological congruence and packet treatment.

      [RFC9551] uses Combined OAM when it says "In-band OAM: an active
      OAM method that is in band within the monitored DetNet OAM domain
      when it traverses the same set of links and interfaces receiving
      the same QoS and Packet Replication, Elimination, and Ordering
      Functions (PREOF) treatment as the monitored DetNet flow."
      [I-D.ietf-raw-architecture] uses similar text.

2.2.  Historical Uses

   There are many examples of "in-band OAM" and "out-of-band OAM" in
   published RFCs.  While interpreting those, it is important to
   understand the semantics of what "band" is a proxy for, and to be
   more explicit if those documents are updated.  This document does not
   change the meaning of any terms in any prior RFCs.

   For example, [RFC5085] says "as in-band traffic with the PW's data,
   or out-of-band", and "in-band (i.e., following the same data-plane
   faith as PW data)".  Hence, in that specific case, the term "band"
   refers to the "Pseudowire data".

3.  Active, Passive, Hybrid, and Compound OAM

   [RFC7799] provides clear definitions for active and passive
   performance assessment such that the construction of metrics and
   methods can be described as either "Active" or "Passive".  Even
   though [RFC7799] does not include the specific terms "Active",
   "Passive", or "Hybrid" as modifiers of "OAM", the following terms are
   used in many RFCs and are provided here for use in all future IETF
   documents that refer to OAM.

Internet-Draft             Characterizing OAM              December 2024


   Active OAM:
      Depends on injected, dedicated-packet OAM.

   Passive OAM:
      Depends solely on the observation of one or more existing data
      packet streams and does not use dedicated-packet OAM.

   Hybrid OAM:
      Uses instrumentation or modification of data packets themselves.
      [RFC9341] and [RFC9197] are examples labeled "Hybrid OAM" under
      this definition.

   Compound OAM:
      Uses a combination of at least two of Active OAM, Passive OAM, and
      Hybrid OAM.  Note that Section 3.7 of [RFC7799] also uses the term
      "Hybrid" to refer to metric types in-between active and passive,
      for OAM there are no in-betweens per se, only active, passive,
      hybrid, or a compound combination.

      Compound OAM can be characterized in a more explicit way, for
      nuanced use-cases, and named according to the OAM types that are
      combined:

      *  Active-Passive OAM.

      *  Active-Hybrid OAM.

      *  Hybrid-Passive OAM.

      *  Active-Hybrid-Passive OAM.


      When two or more OAM types are combined, it is simply the case
      that both OAM types are used at once.  For example, in Active-
      Passive OAM both specific OAM packets and the observation of data
      packets may be used to provide information about the data flow in
      the network.  Each component may supplement the total data.

   Note that [RFC7799] describes "passive methods" as "out of band"
   which is contrary to the concept of "Passive OAM" as defined here
   because there are no OAM packets to be in-band or out-of-band.
   Following the guidelines of this document, OAM may be qualified
   according to the terms described in Sections 2 and 3 of this
   document, and the term "out of band OAM" is not to be used in future
   documents.

4.  Extended OAM Abbreviations

   This document recommends avoiding the creation and use of extended
   abbreviations for the qualifiers of "OAM".  For example, the first
   "O" in "OOAM" could mean out-of-band, overlay, or something else.

   [RFC9197] and other dependent documents currently uses the
   abbreviations "IOAM" for In situ Operations, Administration, and
   Maintenance (IOAM).  While this document does not obsolete that
   abbreviation, it still recommends that the expanded "in situ OAM" is
   used instead to avoid potential ambiguity.

5.  Processing of OAM Packets by Nodes

   There are multiple processing capabilities that nodes processing OAM
   packets can utilize.  Some of those capabilities are explained in
   [RFC9197] for in situ OAM and are further generalized in this
   document.

   Depending on the Type of OAM processing, nodes are categorized as
   follows.  Please note that this characterization exists within the
   context of a particular OAM protocol instance, and a given node can
   support multiple types.

   *  Hybrid OAM instruments or modifies data packet themselves.
      Consequently:

      Encapsulating Node:
         Adds OAM information to data packets.

      Transit Node:
         May process OAM information in data packets.

      Transparent Node:
         Does not process or even notice OAM information in data
         packets.  Does not drop OAM packets.

      Decapsulating Node:
         Removes OAM information from data packets.

   *  Active OAM uses dedicated-packet OAM, separate from data packets.
      Consequently:

      OAM Source Node:
         Creates and injects OAM packets into a flow.

      OAM Sink Node:
         Processes and removes OAM packets from a flow.

Internet-Draft             Characterizing OAM              December 2024


      A node could be an OAM Source Node and an OAM Sink Node for Active
      OAM packets simultaneously.

   In some use-cases, such as in situ OAM described in [RFC9322],
   Compound OAM is used.  In the forward direction, Hybrid OAM is used
   with a single Encapsulating Node.  Multiple Transit Nodes may process
   the OAM information, and this may trigger them to act as OAM Source
   Nodes for Active OAM sent back to the Encapsulating Node which serves
   as an OAM Sink Node.

6.  Security Considerations

   Security is improved when terms are used with precision, and their
   definitions are unambiguous.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
