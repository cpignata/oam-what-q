                  Guidelines for Characterizing "OAM"
               draft-ietf-opsawg-oam-characterization-10

Abstract

   As the IETF continues to produce and standardize different
   Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) protocols and
   technologies, various qualifiers and modifiers are prepended to the
   OAM abbreviation.  While, at first glance, the most used appear to be
   well understood, the same qualifier may be interpreted differently in
   different contexts.  A case in point is the qualifiers "in-band" and
   "out-of-band" which have their origins in the radio lexicon, and
   which have been extrapolated into other communication networks.

   This document considers some common qualifiers and modifiers that are
   prepended, within the context of packet networks, to the OAM
   abbreviation and lays out guidelines for their use in future IETF
   work.

   This document updates RFC 6291 by adding to the guidelines for the
   use of the term "OAM".  It does not modify any other part of RFC
   6291.

1.  Introduction

   It is not uncommon for historical and popular terms to have nuances
   in how they are interpreted or understood.  This was, for example,
   the case with the abbreviation for Operations, Administration, and
   Maintenance, "OAM", and [RFC6291] provided guidelines for its use as
   well as definitions of its constituent parts.

   Characterizations or qualifiers for "OAM" within packet networks
   often encounter similar problems of interpretation, such as with the
   adjective phrases "in-band" and "out-of-band".  This document
   considers some common qualifiers and modifiers that are prepended to
   the OAM abbreviation, and lays out guidelines for their use in future
   IETF work to achieve consistent and unambiguous characterization.

Internet-Draft             Characterizing OAM                August 2025


   This document updates [RFC6291] by adding to the guidelines for the
   use of the term "OAM".  It does not modify any other part of
   [RFC6291].

2.  In-Band and Out-of-Band OAM

   Historically, the terms "in-band" and "out-of-band" were used
   extensively in radio communications as well as in telephony signaling
   [RFC4733].  In both these cases, there is an actual "Band" (i.e., a
   "Channel" or "Frequency") to be within or outside.

   While those terms, useful in their simplicity, continued to be
   broadly used to mean "within something" and "outside something", a
   challenge is presented for IP communications and packet-switched
   networks (PSNs) which do not have a "band" per se, and, in fact, have
   multiple "somethings" that OAM traffic can be carried within or
   outside.  A frequently encountered case is the use of "in-band" to
   mean either In-Data-Packet or on-path.

   Within the IETF, the terms "in-band" and "out-of-band" cannot be
   reliably understood consistently and unambiguously.  Context-specific
   definitions of these terms are inconsistent and therefore cannot be
   generalized.  More importantly, the terms are not self-defining to
   any further extent and cannot be understood by someone exposed to
   them for the first time, since there is no "band" in IP.

   There are many examples of "in-band OAM" and "out-of-band OAM" in
   published RFCs.  For instance, the term "in-band" appears in both
   Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV) [RFC5085] and OAM
   for Deterministic Networking (DetNet) [RFC9551].  While the context
   in each of these documents is clear, the term carries different
   meanings in each case.  These two examples, as well as other examples
   of uses of the term "in-band" in previous documents are described
   throughout Section 3.

   While interpreting existing documents, it is important to understand
   the semantics of what "band" is a proxy for, and to be more explicit
   if those documents are updated.  This document does not change the
   meaning of any terms in any prior RFCs.

3.  Terminology and Guidance

   This document recommends avoiding the terms "in-band" and "out-of-
   band" when referring to OAM.  Instead, it encourages the use of more
   fine-grained and descriptive terminology.  The document also presents
   alternative terms and definitions for use in future IETF documents
   referencing OAM, without precluding the use of other precise,
   descriptive terms that do not rely on the "-band" convention.

Internet-Draft             Characterizing OAM                August 2025


   The terminology presented in this section classifies OAM according to
   three criteria: whether it operates in an active, passive, or hybrid
   mode; whether it follows the same path as data traffic; and whether
   it receives the same treatment as data traffic.

3.1.  Active, Passive, Hybrid, and In-Data-Packet OAM

   [RFC7799] provides clear definitions for active and passive
   performance assessment, enabling the construction of metrics and
   methods to be described as either "Active" or "Passive".  Even though
   [RFC7799] does not explicitly use these terms as modifiers of "OAM",
   they are widely used in practice and are included here for clarity.
   The terms "Active", "Passive" and "Hybrid", as described below, are
   consistent with [RFC7799].  This document does not update or change
   the terms of [RFC7799].

   Active OAM:
      Depends on dedicated OAM packets.

   Passive OAM:
      Depends solely on the observation of one or more existing data
      packet streams and does not use dedicated OAM packets.

   Hybrid OAM:
      Uses augmentation or modification of the packet stream.  [RFC7799]
      makes a distinction between Hybrid Type I, referring to a single
      stream of interest, and Hybrid Type II, referring to two or more
      streams of interest.

   This document defines the term In-Data-Packet OAM as a more specific
   and narrowly scoped instance within the broader category of Hybrid
   OAM.

   In-Data-Packet OAM:
      The OAM information is carried in the packets that also carry the
      data traffic.  This is a specific case of Hybrid OAM.  It was
      sometimes referred to as "in-band".

   The following examples illustrate the terms Active, Passive, Hybrid,
   and In-Data-Packet OAM:

   *  The MPLS echo request/reply messages [RFC8029] are an example of
      "Active OAM", since they are described as "An MPLS echo request/
      reply is a (possibly MPLS-labeled) IPv4 or IPv6 UDP packet".

   *  Monitoring a packet stream by maintaining counters for the packets
      within the stream is an example of "Passive OAM".

Internet-Draft             Characterizing OAM                August 2025


   *  An example of "Hybrid OAM" that is also "In-Data-Packet OAM", is
      an IOAM [RFC9197] trace option that is incorporated into data
      packets.  According to [RFC9197], IOAM '...records OAM information
      within the packet while the packet traverses a particular network
      domain.  The term "in situ" refers to the fact that the OAM data
      is added to the data packets rather than being sent within packets
      specifically dedicated to OAM.'

   *  Another example of "Hybrid OAM" that is also "In-Data-Packet OAM"
      is Alternate Marking [RFC9341], when applied to data packets.  In
      this case a small number of bits in the packet header is used for
      marking a subset of packets in a flow.

   *  An example of "Hybrid OAM" which is not classified as "In-Data-
      Packet OAM" is Direct loss measurement [RFC6374], in which user
      packets are not modified by the protocol.  Instead, OAM packets
      are used to exchange information about user packet counters,
      allowing for packet loss computation.

   *  Another example of "Hybrid OAM" which is not "In-Data-Packet OAM"
      is the case where a packet stream is (actively) generated while an
      existing stream of interest is (passively) observed.  This example
      was introduced in [RFC7799] as a Hybrid method.

3.2.  Path Followed OAM

   Path-Congruent OAM:
      The OAM information follows the exact same path as the observed
      data traffic.

   Non-Path-Congruent OAM:
      The OAM information does not follow the exact same path as the
      observed data traffic.  This can also be called Path-Incongruent
      OAM.

   In this document, the term "path-congruent packets" describes packets
   that follow the exact same path (i.e., traverse the same nodes and
   links) within a network.  Note that this definition does not describe
   how the packets are treated in queues within the nodes on the path.
   A further concept, "equal-forwarding-treatment" describes how path-
   congruent packets receive the same forwarding treatment (e.g.,
   Quality of Service (QoS)).

   An example of "Path-Congruent OAM" is the Virtual Circuit
   Connectivity Verification (VCCV) Type 1 [RFC5085], which was also
   referred to as In-Band VCCV.  The term "congruent" also appears in
   [RFC6669] in the context of path sharing.

3.3.  Packet Forwarding Treatment OAM

   Equal-Forwarding-Treatment OAM:
      The OAM packets receive the same forwarding (e.g., QoS) treatment
      as user data packets.

   Different-Forwarding-Treatment OAM:
      The OAM packets receive different forwarding (e.g., QoS) treatment
      as user data packets.

   The motivation for Equal-Forwarding-Treatment OAM lies in the desire
   to ensure that OAM packets experience the same network conditions as
   the user data they are intended to monitor.  This includes not only
   traversing the same topological path but also receiving identical
   Quality of Service (QoS) treatment, such as queuing, scheduling, and
   traffic shaping.  When both topological and forwarding treatment
   equivalence are achieved, the OAM packets are said to exhibit fate-
   sharing [RFC7276] with the data traffic.  Fate-sharing ensures that
   any impairments or anomalies affecting the user traffic are also
   reflected in the behavior of the OAM packets, thereby making the
   results of the OAM observations more operationally meaningful and
   actionable.  Without such equivalence, discrepancies in treatment
   could lead to misleading measurements or diagnostics, and even
   inadequate corrective actions, reducing the utility of the OAM
   mechanism for performance monitoring and fault detection.

   An example of "Equal-Forwarding-Treatment OAM" is presented in
   [RFC9551] in the context of DetNet OAM: "it traverses the same set of
   links and interfaces receiving the same QoS and Packet Replication,
   Elimination, and Ordering Functions (PREOF) treatment as the
   monitored DetNet flow".

3.4.  Using Multiple Criteria

   OAM protocols and tools can be classified according to the three
   criteria that were described in the previous sections.  However, not
   all criteria are applicable to all OAM protocols, and not all
   combinations are necessarily possible.

   When defining a new OAM protocol or analyzing an existing one, it is
   recommended to explicitly consider which of these criteria are
   applicable and to describe the protocol accordingly.  As a first
   step, all OAM mechanisms can be classified according to the first
   criterion, as Active, Passive, or Hybrid/In-Data-Packet.  Further
   classification according to the other two criteria should be
   considered on a case-by-case basis.

Internet-Draft             Characterizing OAM                August 2025


   In some cases, certain criteria are not relevant, or not all
   combinations are possible.  For example:

   *  Passive OAM relies solely on observing existing data traffic and
      does not generate dedicated OAM packets.  As such, the path
      congruence and forwarding treatment criteria are not relevant,
      since no dedicated OAM packets are exchanged between the
      measurment points.

   *  Non-Path-Congruent OAM, by nature, cannot be Equal-Forwarding-
      Treatment.

   A few examples of OAM classification according to the three criteria
   are presented below:

   *  IP Ping, which uses ICMP Echo messages, can be classified as
      Active OAM.  Since it is not guaranteed to follow the same path or
      receive the same treatment as user data packets, it is classified
      as Non-Path-Congruent and, consequently, as Different-Forwarding-
      Treatment.

   *  When an IOAM trace option [RFC9197] is incorporated in data
      packets it can be classified as In-Data-Packet, Path-Congruent and
      Equal-Forwarding-Treatment.

   *  VCCV [RFC5085], as discussed above, is classified as Active, Path-
      Congruent and Different-Forwarding-Treatment.

   *  MPLS inferred loss measurement [RFC6374] uses specially generated
      test messages, and therefore can be classified as Active.  It is
      also Path-Congruent, and can be deployed either as Equal- or
      Different-Forwarding-Treatment OAM.  MPLS direct loss measurement
      [RFC6374] uses OAM messages that exchange counters that count user
      data traffic.  Hence, it is classified as Hybrid OAM, and as in
      the inferred mode, it is Path-Congruent, and can be either Equal-
      or Different-Forwarding-Treatment OAM.

   In measurement protocols, accurate results depend on path congruence
   and equal forwarding treatment.  In contrast, these properties are
   not always required in other OAM protocols.  For example,
   Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) control packets are often
   sent with the highest priority, which means they do not adhere to the
   equal forwarding treatment property.

   This multi-dimensional classification enables a more precise and
   consistent understanding of OAM mechanisms.

Appendix A.  Examples of the Use of the Term In-Band

   While several instances of the term "in-band" were discussed
   throughout the document, this appendix provides additional examples.
   These are intended to highlight the varying interpretations of the
   term across different contexts.

   In-Data-Packet OAM was in some cases referred to as "in-band".
   Initially, "In situ OAM" [RFC9197] was also referred to as "In-band
   OAM", but was renamed due to the overloaded meaning of "In-band OAM".
   Further, [RFC9232] also intertwines the terms "in-band" with "in
   situ", though [I-D.song-opsawg-ifit-framework] settled on using "in
   Situ".  Other similar uses, including [P4-INT-2.1] and
   [I-D.kumar-ippm-ifa], still use variations of "in-band", "in band",
   or "inband".

Internet-Draft             Characterizing OAM                August 2025


   Path-Congruent OAM was sometimes referred to as "in-band".  As
   described in [RFC5085], "The VCCV message travels in-band with the
   Session and follows the exact same path as the user data for the
   session".  The term "in-band" is also used in Section 2 of [RFC6669]
   with the same meaning.  Non-Path-Congruent OAM was referred to in
   [RFC5085] as Out-of-Band.

   The property of "Equal-Forwarding-Treatment" is referred to in
   [RFC9551] as "In-band OAM".  Similarly, the property of "Different-
   Forwarding-Treatment OAM" can be found in the following definition in
   [RFC9551]: "Out-of-band OAM: an active OAM method whose path through
   the DetNet domain may not be topologically identical to the path of
   the monitored DetNet flow, its test packets may receive different QoS
   and/or PREOF treatment, or both."  [I-D.ietf-raw-architecture] uses
   similar text.
